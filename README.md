1. Real-time data collection: The system must be able to collect real-time data from LEO satellites. This data should include flight paths, aircraft altitude, speed, and other relevant information.

2. Automated response: The system should be able to respond automatically to changes in aircraft altitude, speed, or other relevant data. This will ensure that the necessary adjustments are made quickly and safely.

3. Control of aircraft: The system should be able to control aircraft, including issuing instructions for take-offs, landings, and other necessary maneuvers.

4. Monitoring of air traffic: The system should be able to monitor air traffic, allowing for automated control of air traffic based on real-time data.

5. Alert system: The system should be able to alert the relevant authorities in case of any suspicious activity or potential air traffic accidents.

6. Security: The system should be secure, preventing any unauthorized access or manipulation of data. The system should also be able to encrypt data transmissions, ensuring that sensitive data is not intercepted by unwanted parties.

# Air Traffic Control Platform

This platform is designed to provide automated control of air traffic based on real-time data from LEO satellites. The platform uses quantum-resistant cryptography as its primary security controller, ensuring that all data transmissions are secure and cannot be intercepted or manipulated by unwanted parties.
